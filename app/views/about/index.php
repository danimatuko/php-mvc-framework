<p>This is the About page of our PHP MVC framework.</p>

<h2>What is PHP MVC?</h2>
<p>PHP MVC is a design pattern used in web development to separate the application logic into three interconnected
    components:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model:</strong> Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
    <li><strong>View:</strong> Handles the presentation layer and user interface of the application.</li>
    <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Manages the communication between the Model and View, and handles user input
        and actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features of Our Framework</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Modularity and Code Organization: Our framework follows the MVC architecture, providing a structured way to
        organize your code.</li>
    <li>Routing: We offer a powerful routing system that maps URLs to the appropriate controllers and actions.</li>
    <li>Database Abstraction: Our framework includes a database abstraction layer to simplify database operations.
    </li>
    <li>Template Engine: We provide a template engine to separate the presentation logic from the application logic.
    </li>
    <li>Form Handling and Validation: Our framework includes form handling and validation features to streamline
        form processing.</li>
    <li>Security: We have implemented security measures to help protect your application from common
        vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
